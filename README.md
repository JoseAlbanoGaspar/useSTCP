# STCPGraphProject

This project shows us the best options to move around Porto using STCP buses.

## How to run
> Compile and run the code (main.cpp)

## What to expect?

You can expect 5 different modes:
- Shortest path (by distance)
- Shortest path (by number of stops)
- Cheapest path (less zones)
- Most Convenient path (less line's exchange)
- Bus + Walking path

For each mode you can insert directly the station where you want to enter and exit or you can use latitude and longitude to tell the program your initial and final position.

Then the program will compute the best path based on the user input using some graph related algorithms like the Dijkstra algorithm
